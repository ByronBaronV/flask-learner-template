# Flask Routes Code Blocks

This folder contains example code blocks for creating routes in your Flask application. Each example demonstrates different routing patterns and best practices.

## Quick Start
1. Copy the code blocks you need
2. Modify routes and function names to match your needs
3. Make sure to import required modules
4. Remember that route names must be unique

## Files in this Directory

- `basic_routes.py`: Simple GET and POST routes
- `dynamic_routes.py`: Routes with URL parameters and query strings
- `form_handling.py`: Examples of handling form submissions

## Common HTTP Methods
- GET: Retrieve data (default)
- POST: Create new data
- PUT: Update existing data
- DELETE: Remove data

## Important Tips
1. Always validate form data before processing
2. Use appropriate HTTP methods for each action
3. Return proper status codes (200 for success, 404 for not found, etc.)
4. Use url_for() instead of hardcoding URLs
5. Handle errors gracefully with error routes

## Common Issues
1. "Method Not Allowed": Wrong HTTP method used
2. "Not Found": Route doesn't exist or is misspelled
3. "Bad Request": Invalid form data
4. Forgetting to import required modules (request, redirect, etc.)
